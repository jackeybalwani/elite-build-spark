# Demo Script: Challenge Platform

## What This Platform Does (In Simple Terms)

This is a web app that connects two types of users:
- **Sponsors** (companies) who need solutions to problems
- **Builders** (developers/designers) who want to solve those problems for prizes

Think of it like a marketplace for challenges. Companies post challenges, builders submit solutions, and the best solution wins the prize.

## Demo Flow (5 Minutes Total)

### Part 1: Sponsor Experience (2 minutes)

**[Start at homepage]**

"Let me show you how this works from a company's perspective. When a company signs up as a Sponsor..."

"...they automatically get access to their own dashboard where they can:"

**[Show My Challenges tab]**
- "See all challenges they've posted"
- "Track how many submissions each challenge has"
- "Monitor deadlines and prize amounts"

**[Click Create Challenge]**
- "Post new challenges using this simple form"
- "Set a prize amount, deadline, and describe what they need"
- "List required skills so builders know if they're a good fit"

**[Quick fill: "Design Mobile App UI", "$1,000", future date, "UI/UX Design"]**

"Once they create a challenge, it goes live immediately and builders can start submitting."

**[Show Submissions tab]**
- "All submissions come here"
- "Sponsors can review each one, see who submitted it"
- "When they find a winner, they select it and that builder gets the prize"

**[Show Analytics tab briefly]**

### Part 2: Builder Experience (2 minutes)

**[Log out, sign in as builder@example.com / password123]**

- "They see all active challenges they can work on"
- "Each card shows the prize, deadline, and required skills"
- "They can browse and find challenges that match their expertise"

**[Click on a challenge]**
- "When they click on one, they see full details"
- "Clear requirements, evaluation criteria, everything they need to know"

**[Show submission form]**
- "Then they submit their solution right here"
- "Add a description, upload files or links to their work"
- "Hit submit and the sponsor gets notified immediately"

**[Show Leaderboard]**
- "There's also a leaderboard that tracks top builders"
- "This gamifies it - builders compete to get on top based on wins and submissions"
- "Creates recognition and encourages quality work"

### Part 3: Tech Stack & Approach (1 minute)

"Let me quickly cover how this is built:"

**Frontend:**
- "React with TypeScript - so the whole codebase is type-safe and catches errors early"
- "Tailwind CSS for responsive design - works great on desktop, tablet, and mobile"
- "Modern UI components from shadcn/ui - consistent, accessible interface"

**Backend:**
- "Lovable Cloud powered by Supabase - gives us a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time features"
- "Row-Level Security policies - data access is enforced at the database level, not just in code"
- "JWT authentication - secure, industry-standard login system"

**Key Technical Approach:**
- "Role-based access control - when you sign up, you choose your role and the system automatically assigns the right permissions"
- "Everything happens through database triggers - your role is set automatically, you can't manually change it"
- "Security is built-in - sponsors can only see their own challenges, builders can only submit to active challenges"
- "Real-time updates - when someone submits, the sponsor sees it instantly"

**About AI/LLM Integration:**
- "Currently there's no AI in the app - it's intentionally kept simple for the MVP"
- "The PRD mentions future plans to add LLM-based automated scoring using GPT-4"
- "But right now, sponsors manually review and select winners - gives them full control"
- "We wanted to validate the core concept first, then add AI enhancements later"

Builder: builder@example.com / password123
```

## If Something Breaks

**Sign-up/login fails?**
â†’ "Let me use a pre-authenticated session" (have screenshots ready)

**Slow loading?**
â†’ "Demo environment is a bit slower, in production this is instant" (keep talking)

**Missing data?**
â†’ "Working with fresh demo data, but normally you'd see [describe what]" (show screenshots)

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. **It's secure by design** - Role permissions are enforced at the database level
2. **It's scalable** - Built on Supabase which handles millions of users
3. **It's simple** - Both user types have clear, focused interfaces
4. **It's type-safe** - TypeScript catches bugs before users see them
5. **It's real-time** - Submissions and updates happen live

## Common Questions You'll Get

**"How do you prevent spam submissions?"**
â†’ "Sponsors review everything before selecting a winner. Future: reputation system + AI filtering"

**"What if sponsor doesn't pay?"**
â†’ "Great question. Production would use escrow. MVP trusts sponsors, perfect for internal use"

**"Can builders work in teams?"**
â†’ "Not yet - current version is individual submissions. Team challenges are on the roadmap"

**"How do you make money?"**
â†’ "Not monetized yet. Validating the concept first. Options: platform fee or sponsor subscriptions"

## Final Tips

- **Talk naturally** - Don't sound like you're reading
- **Show, don't tell** - Click around, let them see it work
- **Own the bugs** - If something breaks, say "That's on the improvement list" and move on
- **Connect to value** - Always explain WHY a feature matters, not just what it does
- **Keep it moving** - 5 minutes goes fast, don't get stuck on one section

Good luck! You've got this. ðŸš€
