Context: [Challenge description, rubric, requirements]

Submission Materials:
- Repository: [README content, key code snippets]
- Pitch Deck: [Extracted text summary]
- Video: [Transcript if available, or metadata]

Task: Evaluate this submission across 4 dimensions with scores 0-100 per dimension.
Provide:
1. Numerical scores for each dimension
2. Overall weighted score (0-100)
3. 2-3 specific strengths (bullet points)
4. 2-3 areas for improvement (bullet points)
5. Recommended badges (if applicable)

Output format: JSON

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk Category | Specific Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|---------------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Marketplace** | Not enough builders sign up | High | Critical | Pre-launch waitlist (500+ signups), partnerships with AI communities (Discord, Twitter), founding sponsor commitments |
| **Marketplace** | Not enough sponsors | Medium | Critical | Outreach to 20+ companies pre-launch, offer 50% discount for first 5 sponsors, focus on companies with active AI hiring |
| **Technical** | LLM scoring inaccurate | Medium | High | Golden set validation (‚â•85% target), human review for top submissions, continuous prompt refinement |
| **Technical** | Sandbox security breach | Low | Critical | Penetration testing, Docker security best practices, regular security audits, bug bounty program |
| **Technical** | Platform downtime during challenge | Low | High | AWS multi-AZ deployment, automated failover, weekly backup testing, 99.5% uptime SLA |
| **Financial** | LLM API costs exceed budget | Medium | Medium | Rate limiting (5 submissions/day per builder), batch processing, OpenAI cost monitoring, fallback to cheaper models |
| **Financial** | Sponsors don't renew | Medium | High | Post-challenge success metrics, showcase hiring outcomes, NPS tracking, dedicated success manager for Enterprise tier |
| **Legal** | IP disputes (plagiarism) | Medium | Medium | Plagiarism detection, clear ToS, arbitration clause, manual review for disputes |
| **Legal** | GDPR violation | Low | Critical | Legal review of privacy policy, data encryption, EU data residency, annual compliance audit |
| **Operational** | Solo founder burnout | High | Critical | 2-week refinement buffer, scope discipline (no feature creep), automate repetitive tasks, consider co-founder or contractor for launch week |
| **Reputation** | Poor quality challenges | Medium | High | Challenge review before publication, sponsor guidelines, community flagging, curate early challenges carefully |
| **Fraud** | Submission manipulation | Medium | Medium | Anti-cheating measures (see Security section), manual review for suspicious patterns, ban policy |

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
1. Secure 3 founding sponsors (Weeks 1-4) ‚Üí Validates demand
2. Build core evaluation pipeline (Weeks 3-6) ‚Üí Technical feasibility

```

**Server broadcasts:**
```javascript
// New submission
{
  event: 'submission:new',
  data: { challenge_id, user_id, rank: null, timestamp }
}

// Score updated
{
  event: 'score:updated',
  data: { submission_id, new_score, new_rank, badges }
}

// Leaderboard changed
{
  event: 'leaderboard:updated',
  data: { challenge_id, top_10: [...] }
}
